# Pulseoximeter
In this code, a MAX30100 pulse-oximeter sensor is used to detect oxygen saturation and pulse rate from a finger. An ESP8266 NODEMCU is used here and it is not limited to  particular Wi-Fi alone: an Access point can be created sothat it can connect with other networks. You will need an ARDUINO IDE for this purpose. The data is sent to the FIREBASE database through a server.
